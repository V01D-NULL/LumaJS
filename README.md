<p align="center">
LumaJS is a React inspired framework with optional SSR capabilities via the `luma-router`, built for learning purposes. It implements/mimics some of the features and APIs of React but is not intended for production use.

### Getting Started

The recommended way to start a new LumaJS project is using create-luma-app:

```sh
# COMING SOON
# This will generate a new LumaJS app in the current working directory.
npx create-lumajs-app
```

LumaJS has a similar API to React or, if SSR is used, next.js.
